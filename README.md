# More Progression
A minecraft mod that builds upon and extends vanilla minecraft progression in multiple ways.

## WIP
This mod is currently in a very early playtesting stage.

## Versions
Fabric: 1.19.2

## Design Goals
Extended Progression: Default minecraft progression from wood to stone to iron to diamond is very enjoyable, but too short. The main goal of this mod is to fix that by introducing tiers beyond diamond.

Straightforward: Each recipe and machine in vanilla minecraft is very simple. This mod keeps this core philosophy by gating content behind tiers instead of long and complicated recipes.

Full Experience: Most content added by official updates introduced great potential, but no execution, causing many items (and other things) to be useless or underused (copper, amethysts, quartz, warden, prismarine, food, and more). This mod focuses on making use of already existing items, rather than adding new ones. Additionally, two new systems (upgrades and gourmet food) are introduced to make you chase after all cool and unique items. For an even fuller experience, it is recommended to play this mod in combination with the [End Remastered](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/endremastered) mod.

## Features
**Upgradable** (*search for $upgradable in REI*): Instead of constantly crafting new tools and armor, you craft them once, and then upgrade them. Nearly all the work you do, goes into improving your tools and armor. As such, you really don't want to lose them. Luckily, they are unbreakable, fireproof, and soulbound.

**Tier Cores** (*search for $tier in REI*): These elevate your tools and armor to an entirely new level each time you merge them in the smithing table, changing their looks and becoming considerably more powerful.

**Upgrades** (*search for $upgrade in REI*): There's all kinds of different items that can be used to upgrade your arsenal via the smithing table. Most simply increase your damage or armor, but others give more powerful effects, such as a headlight, insomnia immunity, a step assist, or even an entire jetpack.

**Gourmet Food** (*search for $gourmet in REI*): Explore all kinds of different cuisine, including some previously unedible items (glistering melon, turtle egg, nether wart, and more), as well as new items (star apple, cosmic soup, and more).

**Monster Squads**: Monsters now have a small chance to have a military rank (general, commander, warlord, and more) assigned to them by the monster empire based on their capabilities. These are way stronger than normal mobs, and always spawn with their own squad of even more mobs. Higher ranked mobs have more squad members, some of which may even have a rank of their own. However, ranked monsters drop enchantments that increase with their ranks.

**Difficulty Scaling**: As your armor increases in tier, the monster empire becomes increasingly wary of you, sending stronger and stronger squads to patrol your area, ensuring the security of the world.

## How To Play
Until iron, nothing changes in terms of tools and armor. However, you can already benefit from any gourmet foods that you can manage to get your hands on.

After that, craft steel bindings and use them to upgrade your iron tools and armor in the smithing table to steel tools and armor. They will stay with you for a while (likely forever), so be sure to not lose them. Now, you can apply any and all upgrades that you can find or craft onto them via the smithing table.

Next are the good old diamonds. Find them and craft their tools and armor as normal. However, instead of using them directly, first apply them to your existing arsenal to upgrade them to the next tier, ultimate diamond. At this point, you're already stronger than diamond.

Now, it's time for a big change. Not only will you need to go to the nether, you will also craft a new, bigger, upgraded crafting table, allowing you to craft an incinerator, which is way faster and unlocks new recipes.

Using the newly acquired incinerator, you can now smelt obsidian into refined obsidian. Together with some redstone, copper, and gold, you can craft the next tier core, refined obsidian module, once again making you significantly stronger.

Next up is a big one. Titan. For it you will need lots(!) of quartz and ember. As they both spawn on all levels, it is recommended to explore the nether and gather them as you go. However, they do spawn more frequently at lower levels, so going there might give you a headstart on the ancient debris grind (though ancient debris now also has a slight chance to spawn at any levels, so you might come across a few while exploring)...

For the rest, it will be up to you to explore.

## Mod Compatibility
Special mod support:  
[Roughly Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items)  
[Frog Legs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/froglegs)  

## Mod Incompatibility
This mod was designed as a standalone experience, as it introduces lots of significant changes to make this much progression possible, including very high damage and armor. This massive change in balance makes this mod very overpowered in combination with other mods. Additionally, its unique tier and armor/tool upgrade system would require other mods to be programmed specifically for this mod to stay relevant.

However, I have not yet come across any errors in combination with other mods. If any are found, they will be listed here.
